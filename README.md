# Business-Dashboard
A simple command center for small business owners to track daily operations, including orders, revenue, inventory, and tasks — all in one elegant view.

## Overview

This dashboard was created to simulate the kind of business enablement tools that I might implement for clients as a tech consultant. It serves as a frontend-only mockup to demonstrate layout design, user experience thinking, and the foundation for future cloud integration.

## Features

- ✅ Orders Today
- ✅ Inventory Alerts
- ✅ Revenue Summary
- ✅ To-Do List (styled task cards)
- ✅ Quick Notes Area (textarea)

---

##  Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (custom design)
- Mobile-responsive layout (basic)
- Future expansion: AWS S3 + Lambda + DynamoDB or RDS

---

##  Purpose

This project was built as part of my technical portfolio to:

- Showcase frontend development for operational dashboards
- Simulate a tool that could support small business efficiency
- Prepare for a future dynamic version using AWS cloud infrastructure

---

##  Branding

Designed in the soft, feminine aesthetic of my ecommerce business, She Manifested LLC, this dashboard reflects my personal brand and how I approach technology as approachable, intuitive, and empowering for modern entrepreneurs.

---

##  Future Enhancements

- 🟣 Convert to a dynamic React front end
- 🟣 Add real-time data with AWS services (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB)
